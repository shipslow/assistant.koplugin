    -- - The part AFTER the underscore is just a descriptive name (can be anything)

    -- Only 4 handlers are supported for new configurations:
    --   openai, anthropic, gemini, responses
    -- Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Grok, Perplexity,
    -- Ollama, Mistral, ...) uses the `openai` handler with its own base_url,
    -- e.g. `openai_deepseek`, `openai_openrouter`.
    --
    -- DISPLAY NAME: add a `display_name` field to any provider. It is shown in
    -- the menu and settings UI instead of the raw key.
    --
    -- LEGACY KEYS: old standalone keys like `deepseek`, `openrouter`, `groq`,
    -- `mistral`, `ollama`, `gemma`, `gigachat` still work for backward
    -- compatibility, but do not use them for new configurations — use the
    -- `openai_*` form with `display_name` instead.

    -- merged with this configuration at startup. They support the same protocols:
    -- openai, anthropic, gemini, responses.
    --
    -- NOTE: no `additional_parameters` needed for basic usage. The handlers use
    -- sensible defaults; only add that field if you need to pass extra API
